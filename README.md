# Buddy v1.0 (Redacted Public Release)

Buddy is a prototype command execution agent designed to simulate intelligent decision-making under local orchestration. It listens for instructions from a local Flask server, executes them, and returns output — acting as a foundation for more complex workflows.

## ✂️ What Happened to the Cool Stuff?

> There used to be some cool stuff here, but it has been redacted for ethical concerns 😔  
> Certain features interacted with online services in ways that might raise eyebrows. Those features have been surgically removed from this release to keep everything squeaky clean.

If you're reading this, you're likely reviewing the project for collaboration, contribution, or portfolio purposes. Know that what remains is the **core logic**, architecture, and philosophy behind a broader autonomous system called **Testbed**.

## 🧠 Components

- `exec_handler.py` – executes system instructions
- `tag_listener.py`, `tag_grabber.py` – listens for or extracts tags from external data sources
- `log_server.py` – simple Flask API to pass commands and collect results
- `/buddy_extension/` – formerly housed extension logic (now redacted)
- `requirements.txt` – cleaned, minimal

## 🚀 Goals (Some Real, Some Aspirational)

- Create a local-first decision agent framework
- Simulate user-driven actions without requiring cloud inference
- Build a platform for sandboxed LLM-powered automation
- Eventually integrate with the **Testbed** orchestration engine

## ⚠️ Legal & Ethical Disclaimer

This version intentionally omits any features that could violate Terms of Service of external platforms. Please do not use this code for automating or interacting with third-party services unless you understand the risks and have permission.

Stay ethical. Stay clever. Build cool shit.
